#Description of the Bot

#The chassis title is Burnout. It contains one wheel in the back and two in the front. 

# This model is a speedy and straightforward design. We plan on using the speed of the design to help us maneuver our own way through obstacles, with gears that allow us to control the direction of the chassis. Some specific objectives would be to find a way to create a speedy race car while being able to turn the vehicle and letting the wheels adjust themselves by going down or up.
