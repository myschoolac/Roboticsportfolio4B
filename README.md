Description of the Bot

The chassis title is Burnout. It contains one wheel in the back and two in the front. Our justification for this design selection is to fulfill 
the need for speed and a cool design. The gears will help function the robot and make it forward and change directions. The objectives are to go up elevated surfaces, maneuver through obstacles.
